Repo for files needed in Project for CS3083 Intro to Databases. 

Files are modified off of code written by Phyllis Frankl to demonstrate the use of Flask. 

Updated init1.py file compares the hashes of passwords and selects queries from the PriCoSha database and PriCoSha database tables. 

Templates files have been updated to reflect the structure of the PriCoSha webapp. 

Further changes will be made to add more features and functionality. 

EDIT: Changes have been made to enable posting, tagging, friending, and 
commenting. Note that the screenshots are now outdated.
